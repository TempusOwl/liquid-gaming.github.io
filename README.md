### Discord Links
## Updating Discord Links

When you need to update the discord invite link there is three places you need to do it right now.
First is in `src/assets/json/mediaLinks.json` in the discord object

Second is in `src/router/index.js` and switch it for the discord router

Third is in `public/discord.html` and update it in the meta tag

### Updating Team Members
Go into the `assets/json` and open the teamMembers.json

This file is written in a certain order to follow the chain of command. It goes like so.

Founders, Administration, Advisors, Staff

then order them alphabetically.

Follow the already written naming for their titles, examples: Administrator, Director_of_Recruitment, Director_of_Rust.

Go to the About.vue in the components folder and check the styles to see if there is one there already for the new member's role. If not add a new one with the same name you used for their role


### Updating Player stats
Player stats json can be found in the `src/assets/json`. In that folder there will be the the current stats and the previous stats.

To update the previous season copy the current seasons top stats and total stats into the files located under the previous stats folder.

Current Stats are updated daily with a python script written by Got2bHockey, ask him for info on that if need be. The bot writes to the `top-stats.json` and `total-stats.json`. Do not move or delete these files.

### Updating countdown to new season

Find the Countdown component call on line 20 of PlayerStats and change the new date to 3 months after the old season finished.
